# Employee Payroll System in Java
Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository contains a comprehensive example of building a terminal-based Employee Payroll System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Through this project, you'll learn how to design and implement abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and explore inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in Java.

# Project Highlights
Abstract Employee Class: Serving as the foundation for different employee types.
Concrete Subclasses: FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee with salary calculation.
User-Friendly Terminal Interface: For easy interaction and data management.
Core OOP Concepts: Demonstrated with practical coding examples
